# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI Flashcards

## 1. Product Overview

The AI Flashcards is a web-based application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards. By leveraging AI, the tool automates the process of creating the flashcards, making it faster and more efficient for learners. The application also supports manual flashcard creation and includes a simple learning module that utilizes a spaced repetition algorithm to help users memorize content effectively.

## 2. User Problem

Manually creating high-quality educational flashcards is a time-consuming and tedious process. This significant time investment discourages many learners from using the spaced repetition learning method, despite its proven effectiveness for long-term memory retention. Furthermore, beginners may not know how to formulate effective flashcards. The AI Flashcards aims to solve these problems, so: speeding up the creation of  high-quality flashcards and making this easier for the beginners.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- *F-01: User Authentication System*
  - User can create an account using an email and password.
  - User can log in and log out.
  - User can change their password.
  - User can delete their account. All associated data will be permanently removed in a GDPR-compliant manner.
  - Important: personal data must be managed in a GDPR-compliant manner. User has the right to access and delete their personal data.

- *F-02: AI-Powered Flashcard Generation*
  - User can submit a plain text input (between 1,000 and 10,000 characters).
  - The application sends this text to LLM using API.
  - LLM generates a list of question/answer (front/back) flashcard proposals.
  - User can review each proposal individually and accept, edit, or reject it.
  - Accepted proposals can be saved to the user's flashcard collection.

- *F-03: Manual Flashcard Creation*
  - User can manually create flashcards via a simple form.
  - The form will have fields for the front (max 200 characters) and back (max 500 characters) of the flashcard.

- *F-04: Flashcard Management*
  - All of a user's flashcards are stored in a single collection.
  - A paginated list displays all saved flashcards.
  - A simple search function allows user to find specific flashcards.
  - User can view the full content of a flashcard.
  - User can edit the front and back content of a flashcard.
  - User can delete a flashcard.

- *F-05: Learning Module*
  - A dedicated "Learning Session" view presents flashcards one by one for study.
  - The session utilizes an integrated spaced repetition algorithm to determine which card to show next.
  - User views the front of the card, reveal the back, and then self-assess their recall. This feedback informs the algorithm.

- *F-06: Internal Analytics*
  - The system will log all flashcard creation events (AI-generated vs. manual).
  - It will track the acceptance rate of AI-generated proposals.
  - This data will be stored internally in the application database to measure the success criteria.
